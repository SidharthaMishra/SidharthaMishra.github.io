                            Memory Game is a card matching game. The cards are shuffled and placed face-down on the board. Once a card is flipped, it remains flipped until a second card is turned over. If both of these cards match, they remain turned over otherwise, they are flipped
                            back. This pattern continues until the user manages to flip and match all the cards on the screen.
